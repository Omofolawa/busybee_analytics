#### Project Title: ETL Process with SSIS for Data Transformation

#### Project Description:
This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. It involves extracting data from CSV files, transforming the data to meet business requirements, and loading it into a SQL Server database for further analysis.

#### Project Features:
- **Data Extraction**: Importing data from multiple CSV files.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, enriching, and joining data using SSIS transformations.
- **Data Loading**: Inserting the transformed data into a SQL Server database.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Ensuring data quality and process integrity.

#### Technologies Used:
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Database
- CSV files for data sources

#### Data Files:
- `Customers.csv`: Contains customer information.
- `Products.csv`: Contains product information.
- `Sales.csv`: Contains sales transactions.

#### Conclusion:
This ETL project showcases how to handle typical data transformation challenges using SSIS. It can be adapted and expanded for more complex scenarios, demonstrating the powerful capabilities of SSIS for data integration.
