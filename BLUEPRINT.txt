Designing an SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) project involves several steps, from defining the requirements to setting up the data sources, 
creating the reports, and configuring deployment. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to designing an SSRS project:

### Project Overview
**Objective:** Create a set of reports for a fictional retail company to track sales performance, inventory levels, and customer demographics.

**Data Sources:** SQL Server database containing sales, inventory, and customer data.

**Reports:**
1. **Sales Summary Report:** A paginated report showing daily, weekly, and monthly sales summaries.
2. **Inventory Report:** A detailed report listing current inventory levels by product category.
3. **Customer Demographics Report:** A report analyzing customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

### Step 1: Define Project Requirements
1. **Understand Business Needs:** Identify the key metrics and insights that the business stakeholders want to see.
2. **Data Source Requirements:** Ensure that the necessary data is available in the SQL Server database, and determine the structure of the 
data (tables, views, stored procedures).

### Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment
1. **Install SSRS:** Ensure that SQL Server Reporting Services is installed and configured on your development machine or server.
2. **Install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT):** Use SSDT within Visual Studio to design and develop your reports.

### Step 3: Create the SSRS Project in SSDT
1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Open Visual Studio and create a new "Report Server Project."
   - Name the project (e.g., "RetailReports").

2. **Add Data Sources:**
   - Right-click the "Shared Data Sources" folder and add a new data source.
   - Configure the connection string to point to your SQL Server database (e.g., `RetailDB`).

3. **Add Datasets:**
   - Right-click the "Shared Datasets" folder and add datasets that will be used across multiple reports.
   - Example Datasets:
     - `SalesData`: Query to retrieve sales information.
     - `InventoryData`: Query to retrieve current inventory levels.
     - `CustomerData`: Query to retrieve customer demographic data.

### Step 4: Design the Reports

1. **Sales Summary Report:**
   - Create a new report named "SalesSummaryReport."
   - Use the `SalesData` dataset to display sales figures.
   - Create groupings for daily, weekly, and monthly sales.
   - Include parameters to allow filtering by date range or product category.
   - Add charts or graphs to visually represent sales trends.

2. **Inventory Report:**
   - Create a new report named "InventoryReport."
   - Use the `InventoryData` dataset to display a detailed list of current inventory.
   - Group by product category and include columns for product name, SKU, current stock level, and reorder level.
   - Highlight products that are below reorder level.

3. **Customer Demographics Report:**
   - Create a new report named "CustomerDemographicsReport."
   - Use the `CustomerData` dataset to analyze customer demographics.
   - Create visualizations such as pie charts or bar graphs to show the distribution of customers by age, gender, location, etc.
   - Include a table showing customer purchase history and average spend.

### Step 5: Configure Report Parameters
- Add parameters to allow users to filter the data within the reports (e.g., by date range, product category, customer segment).

### Step 6: Test the Reports
- Run the reports in SSDT to ensure they work as expected.
- Validate the data against the database to ensure accuracy.
- Adjust the report layout and formatting as needed.

### Step 7: Deploy the Reports
1. **Set Up the Report Server:** Ensure that the SSRS server is configured to host the reports.
2. **Deploy the Project:**
   - Configure the deployment settings in Visual Studio (Report Server URL, etc.).
   - Deploy the reports to the SSRS server.

### Step 8: Configure Report Access and Security
- Set up user roles and permissions on the SSRS server to control who can view or manage the reports.
- Configure subscriptions if users need to receive reports by email.

### Step 9: Monitor and Maintain the Reports
- Regularly review the performance of the reports.
- Update the reports as business needs evolve or data structures change.

### Sample Data for the Project
You can create sample tables such as `Sales`, `Inventory`, and `Customers` in your SQL Server database, with mock data that aligns 
with the reports described above.

# Retail Reports - SSRS Project

## Project Overview
This SSRS project provides a set of reports designed for a fictional retail company. The reports help track sales performance, monitor 
inventory levels, and analyze customer demographics.

## Features
- **Sales Summary Report:** Provides daily, weekly, and monthly sales summaries with filter options for date range and product categories.
- **Inventory Report:** Lists current inventory levels by product category, highlighting items below the reorder level.
- **Customer Demographics Report:** Analyzes customer demographics and purchasing behavior, including visualizations for age, gender, and 
location distribution.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)**
- **SQL Server Database**
- **Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**

## Installation and Deployment
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Update the data source connection strings to point to your SQL Server database.
4. Deploy the reports to your SSRS server using the deployment settings in Visual Studio.

## Usage
- Access the reports via the SSRS web portal.
- Use the report parameters to filter and customize the displayed data.
- Export reports to PDF, Excel, or other formats as needed.

## Sample Data
The project includes sample SQL scripts to create and populate the necessary tables in your SQL Server database. 
This allows you to test the reports with mock data.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you would like to contribute to the project.
