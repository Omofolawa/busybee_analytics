Project Overview: ETL Process with SSIS for Data Transformation

This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project is designed to demonstrate how to use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for efficient 
data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. The project will involve data from multiple sources, transforming it into a 
unified format, and loading it into a destination database.

### Project Description:

#### 1. **Data Sources:**
   - **Customers Data**: A CSV file containing customer information (e.g., ID, Name, Address, Email).
   - **Products Data**: A CSV file containing product information (e.g., Product ID, Name, Category, Price).
   - **Sales Data**: A CSV file containing sales transactions (e.g., Sale ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity, Sale Date).

#### 2. **ETL Process:**

   **Extract Phase:**
   - **Source**: The project will extract data from the provided CSV files.
   - **Task**: Use the `Flat File Source` in SSIS to read data from CSV files.

   **Transform Phase:**
   - **Data Cleansing**: Handle missing or null values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
   - **Data Enrichment**: Calculate new columns like Total Sales (Quantity * Price).
   - **Data Joining**: Use Lookup transformations to join data from the Customers and Products data to enrich the Sales data.
   - **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate sales data by customer or product for analysis.
Transformation Details
Data Cleansing:

Remove any potential duplicates or null values (in this example, data is clean, but this step is essential for real-world data).
Data Enrichment:

Add a new column called TotalSales in the Sales data, which is calculated as Quantity * Price. This requires joining the Sales data with the Products data.
Data Joining:

Use the ProductID from the Sales data to look up the corresponding Price from the Products data, allowing you to calculate the TotalSales column.
Join Sales data with the Customers data to enrich the Sales records with customer details.
Data Aggregation:

Aggregate the data to calculate total sales per customer, total sales per product, etc.
Example Transformation in SSIS:
Flat File Source: Use this to read data from Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Sales.csv.
Lookup Transformation: Join the Sales data with the Products data using ProductID to get the Price and calculate TotalSales.
Aggregate Transformation: Sum up the sales quantities or totals by product or customer.
Data Conversion: Ensure that all data types are consistent and correct before loading into the SQL Server database.
 
  **Load Phase:**
   - **Destination**: The transformed data will be loaded into a SQL Server database.
   - **Task**: Use the `OLE DB Destination` in SSIS to load data into the SQL Server tables.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Extract Data:**
   - Use `Flat File Source` components in SSIS to import data from the CSV files.
   - Validate the structure and data types during import.

#### 2. **Transform Data:**
   - **Data Cleansing**: Implement a `Data Conversion` task to ensure data types are consistent. Use a `Conditional Split` to filter out any records with missing critical data.
   - **Data Enrichment**: Add a `Derived Column` to calculate the total sales amount (Quantity * Price).
   - **Data Joining**: Use a `Lookup` transformation to add product and customer details to the sales data.
   - **Data Aggregation**: Utilize the `Aggregate` transformation to summarize data as required (e.g., total sales per customer or product).

#### 3. **Load Data:**
   - Create a destination table in the SQL Server database.
   - Use the `OLE DB Destination` component to load the cleaned, transformed data into the destination table.
   - Set up logging and error handling to ensure smooth operation.

### Data Files:

**Customers.csv**
**Products.csv**
**Sales.csv**

Summary of Data Issues:
Null Values: Some entries have missing data, such as names, addresses, and emails in the Customers.csv file, or Quantity values in the Sales.csv file.
Duplicates: There are several duplicated rows across all datasets.
Inconsistencies: Addresses and other string fields might have different formats or contain minor typographical errors.
ETL Process Overview:
Data Cleansing:

Remove duplicate records.
Handle null values: either fill in missing data, replace with defaults, or remove rows depending on the context.
Data Transformation:

Aggregate sales data per customer and product.
Calculate total sales amounts using the Quantity and Price columns.
Data Loading:

Load the cleansed and transformed data into the target SQL Server database.


### GitHub ReadMe Summary:

#### Project Title: ETL Process with SSIS for Data Transformation

#### Project Description:
This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. It involves extracting data from CSV files, transforming the data to meet business requirements, and loading it into a SQL Server database for further analysis.

#### Project Features:
- **Data Extraction**: Importing data from multiple CSV files.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, enriching, and joining data using SSIS transformations.
- **Data Loading**: Inserting the transformed data into a SQL Server database.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Ensuring data quality and process integrity.

#### Technologies Used:
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Database
- CSV files for data sources

#### How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the SSIS project in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).
3. Configure the connection managers to point to your SQL Server instance and the CSV files.
4. Execute the SSIS package to perform the ETL process.

#### Data Files:
- `Customers.csv`: Contains customer information.
- `Products.csv`: Contains product information.
- `Sales.csv`: Contains sales transactions.

#### Conclusion:
This ETL project showcases how to handle typical data transformation challenges using SSIS. It can be adapted and expanded for more complex scenarios, demonstrating the powerful capabilities of SSIS for data integration.

### Next Steps:
- **Enhancement**: Integrate more complex transformations, such as slowly changing dimensions.
- **Testing**: Implement automated testing of the ETL process.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation of each SSIS component used.

You can easily adapt this project for different data sets and more advanced ETL scenarios, providing a solid foundation for data engineering and business intelligence work.
